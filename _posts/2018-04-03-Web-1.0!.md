Hurray! Creating a personal website has always been on my to-do list, and I have finally done it. It reminded me of how satisfying it is to create something I enjoy.
Anyway, I will be using this website to document all of my future projects, and occasionally write about tech-related stuff.
I thought of making a tutorial on how to create a website like this, but there are already plenty of tutorials out there so I will just link a few of them below.
  
Tutorials:  
[Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages][tutorial-3]  
[Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub][tutorial-1]  
[Building a Portfolio with Jekyll][tutorial-2]  

Moving forward, I am excited to see what I will be able to achieve with this website. Awesome contents are coming soon!
