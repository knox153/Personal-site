# Trecipe

Trecipe helps travellers to discover wonderful destinations and put together their dream bucket list trip. Users can search for a destination and add it to their travel bucket list. Once a destination is added to a bucket list, they can track their progress and view all the destination on a map.

- Created a full-stack web application in a team of 4 using **TypeScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB** 
- Designed and developed responsive front-end components in **HTML/SCSS** 
- Implemented stateless user authentication with JSON web token, allowing users to sign in and manage their bucket list 
- Integrated Google API to display maps and retrieve destinations
