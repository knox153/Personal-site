# Markdown Macro

Markdown Macro extends Markdown by adding [parameterized macro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)#Parameterized_macro). This enabled saving certain section of Markdown as a variable, and let the user reuse them later with ease. This is especially useful when some parts of the markdown text needed to be repeated with different data. 

- Collaborated in a group of 5 to extend Markdown with macro to increase efficiency and readability 
- Created a parser in the language preprocessor to expand the macro in the Markdown text
