# Buses Are Us

Buses Are Us is an Android application written in Java for UBCâ€™s Software Construction course. Partially written program was provided, and I completed the program to display the bus routes using TransLink's API. A JSON parser is implemented to process data provided by the API. JUnit is used to create unit tests.
