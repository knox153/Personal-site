# Empty Dungeon

Empty Dungeon is my entry for [GMTK Game Jam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019) made within 48 hours. It is a dungeon crawler where the player can only explore one tile at a time. The game can be downloaded in the itch.io page below!

- Written in **Lua** and **LÃ–VE**
- Utilize data-driven design, state machine, tweening, event etc.
- Levels are automatically initialized by parsing the files generated by Tiled. This speeds up the level creation process and allows a non-programmer to create levels easily
