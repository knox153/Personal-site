# Speed It Up!

*Quick playthrough*

This game was created using **Lua** for [LÖVE2d Jam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/love2d-jam-2019) in 72 hours. It is a challenging platformer with a small twist - you can move faster but objects around you will move faster as well!  

The download link is included below, and I have wrote a blog post to document what I learnt during the game jam.
