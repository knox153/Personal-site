# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I've been studying Computer Science at the University of British Columbia since 2016. I am currently in the co-op program, and I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Dec 2020.

I started programming in high school after taking an online course, and I have never stopped since then. Video games also spark my interest in programming, I enjoy thinking and learning about how certain part of the game is implemented. In my free time, I like learning about game development :video_game:, drawing pixel art :art:, hoping to release a game one day.

Below are my resume and some of my working experience. If you have any questions or you'd like to get in touch, feel free to contact me.
